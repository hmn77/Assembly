# Assembly
coding AVR family in assembly.   
  This is real time programming in assembly without ussing any timers nor interrupts.I know it's not wise but that was a good exersice for me.
This project uses AVR to produce a square wave and you can change its frequency and duty cycle with a 4*4 keypad.(It works RT)
